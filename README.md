# forwardDiv
Forward dividends are also called expected future dividends, or projected dividend, or implied dividends. They are critical for valuing any equity products. In other words, the key factor for pricing equity products is to correctly calculate equity forward taking all dividends into account. The stock price is adjusted by dividends over ex-dividend dates.
